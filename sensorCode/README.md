This code is designed for the ESP32 microcontroller, which includes an in-built Wi-Fi module. It collects data from the AD8232 Advanced ECG sensor to monitor heart health and transmits the data to a UBIDOTS server using a secure channel. The AD8232 sensor utilizes three electrodes attached to the user’s body to measure changes in electrical impulses for ECG readings. These electrodes are integrated into a compression garment to maintain a reliable distance from the skin. The ECG data collected can be used to calculate important parameters such as Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Resting Heart Rate (RHR), and heartbeats. These metrics are essential for predicting an individual's heart rate and detecting potential fatal scenarios in advance.
