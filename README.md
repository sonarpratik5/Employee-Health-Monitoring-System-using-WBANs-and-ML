# Employee-Health-Monitoring-System-using-WBANs-and-ML
This is my bachelors thesis which was later compiled in the form of a book chapter in book "Applied Computer Vision and Soft Computing with Interpretable AI" with the title "An Employee Health Monitoring System Using Wireless Body Area Networks and Machine Learning"

The main idea behind this project was to make a reliable system that can help employers better track employee health, due to increasing work related health issues (stress, and depression). We trained an ML model on timeseries ECG data for predicting how likely a person can get an heart attack using parameters like HRV (Heart Rate Varability), Heart Rate, and Resting Heart Rate (RHR). We designed a wearable compression where using wireless sensors including Arduino Lilypad (Microcontroller) and AD8232 Sensor (ECG Sensor) and SpO2 sensor. Here are the images from our experiements. <img width="907" height="426" alt="Screenshot_20221027_125749" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/746be837-11ba-4156-ac09-734e5a8fa6e8" />
